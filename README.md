# supplychain
Writing code to understand how to optimize reconstruction of disrupted supply chain

When all components of a supply chain are functional, delivery scheduling of supplies can be assumed optimal. In normal operation, however, connections are lost and the delivering order of these supplies must be altered.  The goal of this program is to facilitate research to address how supply chains recover once a path is no longer functional.  The optimizing objectives that have already been considered include minimizing maximum tardiness and minimizing the completion time of the last tardy job.  The objective that this program attempts to tackle is minimizing the total tardiness and include job number in prioritization.
