# supplychain
Writing code to understand how to optimize reconstruction of disrupted supply chain

When all components of a supply chain are functional, delivery scheduling of supplies can be assumed optimal. In normal operation, however, connections are lost and the delivering order of these supplies must be altered.  This research attempts to address how supply chains recover once a path is no longer functional.  The optimizing objectives that have already been considered include minimizing maximum tardiness and minimizing the completion time of the last tardy job.  The next objective to be assessed is minimizing the total tardiness and include job number in prioritization, which involves developing pseudo code to understand how to model the problem and implementing this solution in Python.  This objective will be assessed against the other objectives to determine which method is most beneficial to use.
